Hey, I'm Adeola 👋

Great! You have arrived here
I'm a frontend Developer 💻 at aaceinigeriasection and also a Content Creator ✍️
I am self-taught 🚀 and I love talking & writing about Web Development , & Software Development in general.

I have been coding for over four (4) years and am currently a developer with AACEINIGERIASECTION 💸 with experience in working with Core Banking Services and working on Mobile friendly websites having integrated 👨🏻‍💻 and worked with teams from different part of Nigeria.

I 💛 building real-time applications but I mostly work on and experiment with APIs of all sort and have the love to build APIs and deploy them using my favorite operating system MacOS 👾.

I am on a journey to make web Development accessible to everyone in my locale and abroad and I would love to share that journey with you 💛
